Week 06 HW

This Repository has the R code for the Staten Island, SI, data and cleans it. 
After cleaning the data the final product is a plot of log10 home sq ft and log10 sales price.

First it gets rid of the non-numeric characters, then it keeps only the actual sales data.
From there it removes the the log sale prices <=5 and then makes the final plot we are looking for.
